      - label: "Experimentation"
        text: "Designed and productionized a Bayesian A/B testing framework. The framework leverages git, jenkins, and sagemaker for infrastructure, and conjugate priors on the statistics side to handle end to end analysis of all online experimentation - >200 experiments @ >200M sessions over the past two years."
      - label: "Advanced Analytics & Causal Inference"
        text: "Various causal inference projects to derive actionable insights and optimize policy decisions when RCTs were not possible. Methods include linear/generalized linear regression (implemented with DAGs and stakeholder input), difference in difference (pyfixest), double ML (EconML), and BARTs (pymc)."
