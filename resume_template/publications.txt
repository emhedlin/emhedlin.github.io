        Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) rely on seals as their primary prey, yet predator-prey spatial relationships are poorly understood. We examined the spatial relationship between Davis Strait polar bears and harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus), using satellite-telemetry for both species. We analyzed sea ice trends using remote sensing (1979-2021) to examine how their environment may be changing using four sea ice seasons (freeze-up, winter, break-up, and summer). Sea ice cover decreased and summer season lengthened over time. Polar bears (n=23) tracked in 1991-2001 for 7-12 months had a mean 95% minimum convex polygon home range size (MCP) of 102,864 km2 (SE=15,236 km2) and a mean 95% kernel density home range size (KDE) of 66,215 km2 (SE=59,688 km2). Harp seals (n=29) tracked for 5-8 months in 1993-2005 had a mean 95% MCP of 464,330 km2 (SE=47,009 km2) and a mean 95% KDE of 256,016 km2 (SE=31,566 km2). During freeze-up, the core-use areas of both species did not overlap, but the broad-use areas did. During break-up, the broad-use areas overlapped more than the core-use areas. The space use of both species was influenced by the sea ice seasons and these seasons have changed over time.Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) rely on seals as their primary prey, yet predator-prey spatial relationships are poorly understood.

Food supplementing peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus tundrius) nests increases reproductive success with no change in mean parental provisioning rateFood supplementing peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus tundrius) nests increases reproductive success with no change in mean parental provisioning rate

        Parents are expected to exhibit intermediate levels of investment in parental care that reflect the trade-off between current versus future reproduction. Providing parents with supplemental food may allow for increased care to the current brood (additive model), re-allocation of parental effort to other behaviours such as self-maintenance (substitution model), or may provide parents with a buffer against provisioning shortfalls (insurance model). We investigated the impact of parental food supplementation on provisioning behaviour and breeding success in Arctic-breeding peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus tundrius) over five successive breeding seasons (2013-2017). We found that supplemental feeding had no impact on mean provisioning rates, yet resulted in increased nestling survival probability, increased nestling body mass and decreased variance in nestling body mass and provisioning rates. These results are consistent with parents adopting a hybrid of the additive and substitution models. We suggest that food supplementation enables increased investment in other forms of parental care (e.g. nest defence, brooding) without altering mean provisioning rates. The lack of observed effects on mean provisioning rates, coupled with increased survival and body mass of offspring, suggests a potential reallocation of parental effort. The findings contribute to understanding the responses of peregrine falcons to food supplementation, highlighting the need for future studies to explore broader environmental contexts and potential long-term effects on parental survival and future reproduction.Parents are expected to exhibit intermediate levels of investment in parental care that reflect the trade-off between current versus future reproduction.

        The hierarchical model of provisioning posits that parents employ a strategic, sequential use of three provisioning tactics as offspring demand increases (e.g., due to increasing brood size and age). Namely, increasing delivery rate (reducing intervals between provisioning visits), expanding provisioned diet breadth, and adopting variance-sensitive provisioning. We evaluated this model in an Arctic breeding population of Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus tundrius) by analyzing changes in inter-visit-intervals (IVIs) and residual variance in IVIs across 7 study years. Data were collected using motion-sensitive nest camera images and analyzed using Bayesian mixed effect models. We found strong support for a decrease in IVIs (i.e., increase in delivery rates) between provisioning visits and an increase in residual variance in IVIs with increasing nestling age, consistent with the notion that peregrines shift to variance-prone provisioning strategies with increasing nestling demand. However, support for predictions made based on the hierarchical model of tactics for coping with increased brood demand was equivocal as we did not find evidence in support of expected covariances between random effects (i.e., between IVI to an average sized brood (intercept), change in IVI with brood demand (slope) or variance in IVI). Overall, our study provides important biological insights into how parents cope with increased brood demand.The hierarchical model of provisioning posits that parents employ a strategic, sequential use of three provisioning tactics as offspring demand increases (e.g., due to increasing brood size and age).

        This note chronicles nestling mortality among Peregrine Falcons breeding near the community of Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, due to the biting effects of blood-feeding black flies. To our knowledge, these observations document the northernmost lethal attack by ornithophilic black flies in North America.
